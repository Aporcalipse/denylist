Hi, on the last couple of days i foud out one of my hotspots has ben put in the denyal list, after looking around i found that i need to post an issue in github asking for a removal and provide information about the hotspot.

After creating an account when i try to create an issue it gives the information that only contribuitors can post issues.

How can i contribute in order to post a removal request for my hotspot??

Thanks
